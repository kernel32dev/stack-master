/// ### the purpose of this function:
///
/// it establishes the initial execution context and records the stack's upper boundary, known as the "dock".
///
/// this function sets up a root stack frame, calls the entry function, and ensures a clean teardown, allowing the entire system to be started and eventually return a final value.
///
/// ### what this function does:
///
/// * first, it removes its own return address and arguments (`f`, `a`) from the stack, placing them into registers for later use.
/// * it then pushes the original return address back onto the stack, followed by all standard callee-saved registers (`ebp`, `ebx`, `esi`, `edi`). this creates a predictable, restorable stack frame.
/// * next, it pushes the argument `a` for the function `f` that it is about to call.
/// * it then calculates the memory address of this argument on the stack (`esp+4`) and stores this location in the global `STACK_START` static. this address serves as the fixed "dock" point, or the highest memory address for all subsequent stack manipulations.
/// * it calls the provided function `f` with the argument `a`.
/// * once `f` returns, it pops the callee-saved registers to restore the machine state and then executes a `ret` to return to its original caller, passing along the result from `f`.

///
/// ### what this function does:
///
/// * it begins by removing its own return address and arguments (`f`, `a`) from the stack.
/// * it then forcefully resets the stack pointer (`esp`) to the address stored in `STACK_START`. this action instantly abandons the entire current call stack.

///

///
/// this function returns if the callback returns of if the suspended stack was resumed
///
/// ### what this function does:
///
/// * first, it pops its own frame (return address and arguments `f`, `a`) off the stack to expose the caller's stack frame.
/// * it then pushes the return address and all callee-saved registers (`ebp`, `ebx`, `esi`, `edi`) onto the stack. this captures the complete machine state required to resume execution later.
/// * it calculates the start pointer of the stack segment to be saved (the current `esp`) and its total length (the difference between `STACK_START` and `esp`).
/// * it calls the provided callback `f`, passing it the pointer (`esi`), length (`edi`), and context argument (`a`).
/// * if the callback `f` returns, it means the suspension was aborted. the function then restores the callee-saved registers by popping them off the stack and returns normally to its caller.

/// * it calls the post-copy callback `f`, giving the caller a chance to free the buffer that held the saved stack data.
/// * after the callback returns, it begins popping values from the newly restored stack. it first restores the callee-saved registers (`edi`, `esi`, `ebx`, `ebp`).
